- update this version with the little norme changes made in the pushed version
- fix -t time sort (and uUS) by creating a version of get_file_data_one and
  get_file_data_columns with a lstat call in it (this is an optimization error
  that was introduced in commit 40f1d6d "Remove stat when necessary")
- check the all thing with 42fileChecker
- don't forget to manually add libft.a so that it doesn't relink
- renormify this shit
